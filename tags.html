<h3>tag explanation</h3>
<!--<p>
for images in this database, a controlled vocabulary was used in order to standardize all tags appearing in the metadata. tagging will always lead to disputable and vague decisions, as the complexity of the subjects tagged not always makes it easy to decide if a specific tag applies or not. to tackle this inherent quandary it will be laid out what was the rationale behind this vocabulary.<br>

this vocabulary is hierarchical in nature. in most cases, parent tags were given if one or more child tags were given. e.g. if the tag ‘compass’ (child) applies, also the tag ‘instrument’ (parent) applies. this avoids tags such as ‘other’ and makes the set searchable to a higher degree. tags that only function as parent tag but are not assigned anywhere are put in square brackets.<br>

the main distinction between all tags is whether they describe the content or the graphical elements and the medium of the image. content tags describe what is represented by the image while element tags describe its appearance and visual elements while medium tags entail information about its production. <br>

all images are tagged against the thematic background of this project on magnetism and its (limited) corpus. other material deserves another vocabulary. quasi-universal vocabularies such as iconclass will not allow to ask the research questions that are underpinning this historical research
