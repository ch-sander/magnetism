This image database currently focusses on printed editions and does not include multiple editions of the same work. This database is frequently updated [last 29.05.2022].

Each image has precise metadata (click on any item or zoom in) and the full page and transcriptions for most images are given there (see top of the sidebar and external link) as well to see its context.

The keywords represent the most common themes in the images, including their content, their visual styles and the materiality. Tags marked as '(work)' relate to the work the image is contained in. For a full documentation, see [PDF](https://ch-sander.github.io/raramagnetica/docs/tags.pdf) and [HTML](https://ch-sander.github.io/raramagnetica/tags.html).

See statistics for all tags used [here](https://ch-sander.github.io/raramagnetica/vismag_stats.html).

Click on the keywords to narrow the selection of images.

For a better overview all images are arranged based on time ranges of 10 years. The metadata of each image provides a more precise dating. Alternatively, switch to similarity mode to arrange images based on image similarity as calculated via the [mobilenet activation logit](https://beta.observablehq.com/@cpietsch/imagenet-activation-logit).
