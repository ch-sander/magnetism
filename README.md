# rara magnetica
In 1898, Gustav Hellmann published his anthology called _Rara magnetica_ (1269-1599). With this collection, he aimed at making available some of the earliest, yet rare publications in the field of geomagnetism that predated William Gilbert's _De magnete_ of 1600.

This website has a similar goal. While the concept of rarity has deeply changed in the digital era, it still needs ways to re-publish relevant but understudied sources â€“ or sources that are not available in modern machine readable editions but should be.

This website will therefore publish less and well known sources for the study of magnetsm in the premodern era. It  will include both images and texts and provide tools to investigate  each of them independently and both of them in combination.
